# TuxGuitar-InstaShred-Windows
A TuxGuitar plugin for use with InstaShred guitars

## Description


## Installation Instructions
Download and install the appropriate Windows release from the [Source Forge project site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/files/TuxGuitar/).

Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/InstaShred/TuxGuitar-InstaShred-Windows/releases) and download both the Javelin_x32.dll and tuxguitar-instashred--SNAPSHOT.jar files. Save both of these files in the /share/plugins directory of your TuxGuitar installation. If you are having trouble finding this directory, right click your TuxGuitar shortcut and select "Open file location".

The Bluetooth search window (Discovered Devices) should open automatically, but if not go to "Tools > Plugins" and make sure the "InstaShred" plugin is enabled. Once the Bluetooth search window appears, press "Scan for Devices" and then select your InstaShred guitar before pressing "Connect". After a successful connection, the connected lightshow will display on your guitar and the Bluetooth search window will close. You are now ready to use TuxGuitar with your InstaShred gutiar!
